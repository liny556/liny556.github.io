## Welcome!

My name is Guangyu Li, a senior student at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Now, I am devoted in appling a PhD position, if you are interest about my research experience, feel free to contact me!

Furthermore, I am personally interested in all kinds of directions and hope to try more directions in the future to solve really meaningful problems or understand the data in daily life better.

## Research Interests

- **Statistical Computation:** Sampling Algorithm, MCMC
- **Machine Learning:** Scalable, reliable and efficient probabilistic models, data-driven model like RNA-Seq analysis etc.
