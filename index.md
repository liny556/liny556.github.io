## Welcome!

My name is Guangyu Li, a senior student at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Now, I am actively applying for a PhD position, if you are interest about my research experience, feel free to contact me![[mail](flipped@mail.ustc.edu.cn)]

## Research Interests

- **Computational Statistics:** Numerical optimization, Monte Carlo Methods.
- **Machine Learning and Generative AI:** Scalable, reliable and efficient probabilistic models, Generative models, including LLMs, VLMs, and diffusion models.
- **AI-Healthcare:** Computational Pathology, AI assistant in medical diagnose.

Furthermore, I am personally interested in all kinds of directions and hope to explore more research fields in the future to combine theoretical statistical foundations with AI implementations.
