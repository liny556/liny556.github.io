## Welcome!

My name is Guangyu Li, a senior student at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Now, I am actively applying for a PhD position, if you are interest about my research experience, feel free to contact me!

## Research Interests

- **Computational Statistics:** Sampling Algorithm, MCMC methods.
- **Machine Learning:** Scalable, reliable and efficient probabilistic models, Generative models, Data-driven models like RNA-Seq analysis etc.
- **Optimization:** Combinatorial optimization, Bayesian Optimization.

Furthermore, I am personally interested in all kinds of directions and hope to try more directions in the future to solve really meaningful problems or understand the data in daily life better.
