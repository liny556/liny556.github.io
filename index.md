## Welcome!

My name is Guangyu Li, a senior student at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Now, I am actively applying for a PhD position. If you are interested in my research experience, feel free to contact me! [[mail](flipped@mail.ustc.edu.cn)]

## Research Interests

- **Computational Statistics:** Numerical Optimization, Monte Carlo Methods.
- **Probabilistic ML & Generative AI:** Scalable & Efficient Probabilistic Models, Uncertainty Estimation, Bayesian Methods, Alignment & Safety of Foundation Models.
- **AI for Healthcare:** Computational Pathology, AI Assistant in Medical Diagnosis.

Furthermore, I am interested in various directions and hope to explore additional research fields in the future, combining theoretical statistical foundations with AI implementations.
